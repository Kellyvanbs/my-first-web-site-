  JavaScript often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is
  one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11]
  As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
  [12] often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers have
  a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
  to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
  and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional,
  and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
  for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
